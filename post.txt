6 months ago, I stopped using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Figma, and n8n.

I replaced them all with Claude Code.

Here's what happened:

Instead of paying $800+/year for software subscriptions, I built open-source repos that do the same thing—but better.

The workflow is simple:
1. Clone the repo
2. Write a prompt
3. Get production-ready output

Here's what I built:

openword - Professional business letters & contracts (replaces Word)
opendraft - Academic thesis generation with 19 AI agents (replaces research tools)
openfigma - Social graphics & marketing visuals (replaces Figma/Canva)
openblog - 5-stage SEO content pipeline (replaces n8n + content tools)
openkeyword - AI-powered keyword research (replaces Ahrefs/SEMrush)
openinvoice - Gmail invoice extraction (replaces manual bookkeeping)

All free. All open source.

Clone them, prompt them, ship faster.
